I was a technical consultant before, responsible for Dynamics NAV / Dynamics 365 Business Central customization and implementation. Since it's unethical to disclose customers' codes, I decided to write a series of articles to introduce how to develope in Dynamics NAV / Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Articles are in Chinese, please refer to https://medium.com/@nturay0321 (my Medium repo), or https://reurl.cc/Gy0lW (first article of this series) for more information.

Those articles cover the concept and implementation of event-driven programming, publisher-subscriber design pattern, extensions, tracing standard codes, which are vital when conducting the system customization.

The BC1.00.txt is the modified / added objects (in text format) for this project.
